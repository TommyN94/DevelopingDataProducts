## Welcome!

This repository contains my code solutions for the assignments of the [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products) MOOC offered on coursera by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

For the final course project I created a `shiny` app that let's you interactively explore the medallist of the [2018 WKF World Karate Championships in Madrid](https://www.wkf.net/world-championships-main/senior/) on a world map which I created using `leaflet`. Check it out [here](https://th-neitmann.shinyapps.io/Karate_WC_Map/).
